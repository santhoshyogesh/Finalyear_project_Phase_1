This project focuses on the design of Archimedean Spiral Patch Antennas that operate in the 12–18 GHz (Ku-band) range. The antennas are optimized for wideband performance, circular polarization, and stable radiation—key requirements for modern military communication systems, especially in amphibious environments.

Two antennas with different inter-arm spacings were designed and evaluated using ANSYS HFSS.
